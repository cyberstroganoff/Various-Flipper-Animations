# Various-Flipper-Animations
A collection fo flipper animations that I like, from several sources. There are animations from cartoons, videogames, anime, movies, etc. Nothing NSFW. 

Note: Only the "All" directory is set up properly to put on a Flipper right away with no edits. The other directories are all subsets of the "All" directory, filled with animations in case you just want some of them but not others.

I got my animations from:

https://github.com/IoriKesso/Flipper-Zero-Anime-Wallpapers/tree/main
maybe another place I forget
